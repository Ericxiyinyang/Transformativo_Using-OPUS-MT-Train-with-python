# Transformativo: Practice Project Using OPUS-MT-train

This python program uses the OPUS-MT-train translational models found at https://github.com/Helsinki-NLP/OPUS-MT-train via HuggingFace's Transformers. Just a simple project to practice how something that involves using AI models to translate could be built.
