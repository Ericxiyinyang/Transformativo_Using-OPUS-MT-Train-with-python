# Transformativo: Practice Project Using OPUS-MT-train

This python program uses the OPUS-MT-train translational models found at https://github.com/Helsinki-NLP/OPUS-MT-train via HuggingFace's Transformers. Just a simple project to practice how something that involves using AI models to translate could be built. 

# Getting Started:
Make sure you have python installed, then run the following pip commands(you can install via conda if you want):

1. PyTorch
2. HuggingFace Transformers
3. Python ASCII Art
4. If you are missing something, read the terminal output when trying to run the translator
